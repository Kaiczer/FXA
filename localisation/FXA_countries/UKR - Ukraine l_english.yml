UKR_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "The collapse of the Russian Empire, have allowed the Ukrainians to establish their own state along the Dnieper, however, the German Empire quickly established a puppet state but was forced to evacuate the region following the German revolution of 1918. As so, the Ukrainian People's Republic was re-established, and thrown into the chaos of the Russian Civil War. Coming out victorious against the Bolsheviks, the Ukrainians seeked to distance themselves from Russia, creating a unique identity wedged between Soviet Russia and a resurgent Germany. With tensions once more rising in Europe, Ukraine must place her bets and pick a side, or be lost to the annals of time."
