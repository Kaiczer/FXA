ENG_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "The Great War lasted for five long years of merciless slaughter and destruction. In the end, Britain stood victorious over the butchered Central Powers, establishing itself once more as the global hegemon. The 1931 Statute of Autonomy would grant the Dominion nations only limited powers, with the original proposals being drastically altered resulting in great resentment towards the mother country. Britain is in a precarious position. The Imperial Conference of 1937 looms ever closer and in the years that follow Britain will be faced with choices that will not only determine the fate of the Empire, but of the future of Britain itself."
