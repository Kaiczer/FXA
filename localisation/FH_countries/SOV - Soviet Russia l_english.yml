### History
SOV_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "After their loss in the Great War, the Russian Empire fell into civil war and the soviet_socialist Bolshevik party soon found itself as the ruler of Russia. That power was eventually disputed by anarchist sailors in Kronstadt, who rose up to fight authoritarianism in the nation.

The beacon of socialism worldwide charges headfirst into an unknown future, threatened by Polish ambitions and even by revengeful old Bolsheviks..."
