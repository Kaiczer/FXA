### Events
australia.0.t: "The Land Down Under, 1936"
australia.0.d: "With Federation in 1901, Australia is a relatively new nation in the world stage, yet in this short time Australia has proven to be an influential member of the British Empire.\n\nWith a victory in the Gallipoli campaign, the Australian army was shown to be much stronger than the world believed. The most common criticism always being that they where rowdy and disorganised. Gallipoli showed the world the new nation's strength. The victory has helped to foster the first sparks of an Australian identity, independent from the British.\n\nTo take advantage of the British economic boom the Australian government decided to peg its pound to the British pound, to better accommodate British Imports. This has continued to this day, due to the economic growth that has continued through the 20's and into the 30's.\n\nThe 1934 elections resulted in victory for Joseph Lyons and his United Australia party. Not much has changed since the election, as Australia has been in relative prosperity. Only time will tell whether this will continue."

australia.1.t: "Elections of [GetYear]"
australia.1.d: "As per the Constitution of Australasia, elections are to be held at least once every three years (a legacy of Australian practice). This year's election is particularly important, due to the rise of the Labour Party, and the United Party, which is currently the ruling party, both of which have siphoned support from conservative parties. Will the electorate stick with one of the current party, or will they opt instead for the other ones?"
