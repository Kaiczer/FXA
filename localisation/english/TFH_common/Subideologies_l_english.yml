revolutionary_showaism_subtype: "Revolutionary Showaism"
revolutionary_showaism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Revolutionary Showaism)§!\nSince the present emperor ascended to the Chrysanthemum throne, the Japanese Empire has experienced a significant decline. The economy has reached a critical point, and the immigration of Koreans, along with the liberal impurity in Japanese politics, has only fueled the inspiration of right-wing extremists. Led by militarist advocates and the generals of the Imperial Armed Forces on Yamato Island, their only goal is to purify the island and secure it from the corrupted Western ideology once and for all.\nUnder the banner of Showa restoration, the far-right has embraced nationalistic and other right-wing ideas from Europe, but with a twist of socialism. This has led to the creation of Showaism, an ideology that aims to purify the Japanese Empire. Hashimoto Kingoro, a Japanese officer and one of Showaism's advocates, believes that the combination of revolutionary socialism, stratocracy, and nationalism will cleanse Japanese politics and bureaucracy of the corrupted liberalism. All of this will be done in the name of fairness and equality, based on his interpretation of socialism. And the military will serve as the protector of the new reformed Japanese Empire to ensure and safeguard the new Japan from another wave of corruption."

monarchical_socialism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Monarcho-Socialism)§!\nMonarcho-Socialism, along with its various subtypes such as Monarcho-Bolshevism, Monarcho-Communism, and others, seeks to coherently fuse the typically opposed systems of Socialism and Monarchism into one, unified form of government. Though the degree to which each monarch is dedicated to the Socialist system can vary greatly, from mere figureheads painted Red to monarchs fully dedicated to the Socialist cause, each system holds in common an adherence to the noble system of monarchism, and though this monarch is frequently only a facade for a more traditional Socialist government, their presence is key to the wider system. Under these Red monarchies, the journey to true Socialism is shepherded, and though each system is incredibly varied, they usually hold in common a more conservative or traditionalist outlook on social and societal issues."

Libertarians would argue that such an approach would restrain innovation, limit consumer choice, and result in inefficiencies and waste."
anarcho_syndicalism_subtype: "Anarcho-Syndicalism"
anarcho_syndicalism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Anarcho-Syndicalism)§!\nThe largest subset of mainline Orthodox Syndicalism, Anarcho-Syndicalism seeks to build a Syndicalist system - that is, a system organized around trade unions and employee organizations - within an Anarchist and stateless, or semi-stateless, framework. Seeking to abolish the wage system as well as Capitalist-fueled statism, Anarcho-Syndicalists believe that through solidarity, self-management, communization, direct action, and direct democracy, a true egalitarian paradise can be built for all to enjoy. Rejecting private property, hierarchies, and social stratification, Anarcho-Syndicalists will tear down the state to build their unionist utopias free from the apparent greed of statism."

bukharinism_subtype: "Bukharinism"
bukharinism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Bukharinism)§!\nBukharinism or Semi-Market Socialism is a set of ideas formulated by the Russian Bolshevik Nikolai Bukharin after the Civil War in Russia, which formed the basis of the program of his People's Socialist Party and the rationale for the so-called New Economic Policy.\nBukharin considered the main culprit for the failure of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and the loss of the Reds in the Civil War to be the ineffective policy of \"War communism\", which led to the complete alienation of the peasants from the Bolsheviks and economic crisis. Bukharin, however, in his writings, developed with economist Nikolai Kondratiev, suggested that socialism should be achieved gradually - and that state regulation of a mixed economy using planned and market mechanisms was necessary to achieve this goal. \"Socialism in the city - Capitalism in the countryside\" was how Bukharin characterized his program at the founding congress of the new party. In addition to the economic sphere, Bukharinism proposes a multiparty form of Soviet democracy, separation of powers, and Korenization - support for national minorities by promoting national human resources and limiting Russification."

venizelism_subtype: "Venizelism"
venizelism_subtype_desc: "Venizelism is one of the most significant political movements in Greece since the start of the 20th centrury. During the period of 1910 to 1922, when Greece was in a state of continuous military readiness, a new political mindset emerged, embodied by Eleftherios Venizelos, and was commonly referred to as Venizelism. It is difficult to define in what exactly this political ideology was, but in terms of the economy, Venizelism considered the Greek state as a lever for the expression and development of Hellenism. In other words, the Greek state had to pursue the integration of Hellenism beyond its borders and, with a unified national and state identity, claim its place in the then-modern world. This required not only institutional modernization to make the state efficient and reliable but also a general commitment to the idea of developing the nation's productive forces."

## Social Conservative
christian_democracy_subtype: "Christian Democracy"
christian_democracy_subtype_desc: "§Y(Christian Democracy)§!\nChristian Democratic movements understand that only through allowing people a choice, and not coercion, a religious society might be upheld. Basing its programmes on Catholic social teaching and neo-Calvinism, Christian Democrats strive to create a free society in which traditional family values, social justice and good old fashioned patriotism will be respected. While most Christian Democratic parties don't exclude any denomination, some might choose to keep to a strictly anti-ecumenical position. Surprisingly to some, many advocates for Christian Democracy are rather left leaning in their views on the economy, advocating for models such as Distributism, based on Pope Leo XIII's 'Rerum novarum' encyclical. That position is of course not the only choice, with others preaching the Prosperity Gospel or upholding Christian Capitalism."

He vows to protect Japanese democracy from both extreme nationalists and corrupt politicians, aiming to develop a uniquely Japanese-style democracy tailored to the needs of the nation. Prince Tokugawa envisions the creation of a non-partisan political system that unites everyone under a single banner. In this system, the military's loyalty is to the country rather than the emperor, safeguarding the monarchy from being exploited by nationalists and militarists. This ensures that the military serves as a protective force for the nation as a whole, rather than as a tool for political factions. Combining the principles of Confucianism, Conservative Democracy, and Japanese Nationalism, Prince Tokugawa seeks to forge a new national idea. Under the leadership of the Shogun, Japan will restore its former glory, creating a stable, prosperous, and culturally vibrant nation.

It was here that the Charter of Carnaro, infused with his poetic mastery and camaraderie with vanguard_socialist sympathizers, was penned. This charter brimmed with the vision of a new harmonious nation founded on class cooperation, granting autonomy to various occupations and fostering class democracy to harmonize the existing social strata within the unity of the state."

Under the banner of Showa Restoration, the far-right has adopted nationalistic and right-wing ideas from Europe, infusing them with elements of socialism to create Showaism. This ideology aims to purify the Japanese Empire. Nakano Seigo, a prominent Japanese politician and advocate of Showaism, believes that combining corporatism with national syndicalism can reform the bureaucracy by eliminating corrupt liberal ideas. By making nationalism the central principle in policy-making and relying on trusted and fair overseers, Showaism seeks to protect the Japanese bureaucracy from external threats and maintain its purity."

Frequently egalitarian in some regards despite its Nationalist slant, Integralism and its derivatives are a group of Christian-dominated political oddities."
legionarism_subtype: "Legionarism"
legionarism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Legionarism)§!\nLegionarism, as practiced by the Iron Guard, was a complex and multifaceted ideology that fused fervent nationalism, religious devotion, and authoritarian principles to envision a spiritually and culturally revitalized Romania. It stood firmly against both liberal democracy and communism, advocating for a theocratic and corporatist state where national and religious values were paramount. This ideology emphasized unity, discipline, and cultural heritage, which resonated with many Romanians seeking a return to traditional values and a strong national identity. However, the movement's violent and exclusionary practices, particularly its anti-Semitism and authoritarianism, cast a dark shadow over Romanian history. While it aspired to create a cohesive and morally upright society, the Iron Guard's methods often involved brutality and repression. Members of Legionary parties are often trained to act as militant martyrs in order to become closer to their Nation and God, though less extreme examples exist where Nationalism and Patriotism are expressed far more than martyrdom. In terms of economics, there is no one defined view, although Capitalism and Socialism are usually outright rejected as a corrupting, foreign force, with Corporatism, Right Syndicalism, or other forms of controlled economics largely being dominant. Though the emphasis on religion and zealotry widely differs, most Legionarists are devoutly Catholic or Christian, depending on the nation of origin, and all are deeply devoted to the jingoistic revitalization of their native country."

This ideology emerged from a disdain for Western democracy, parliamentarism, capitalism, and socialism, prompting Völkische theorists to develop a third-position ideology. It is characterized by New German cultural advocacy, Pan-Germanic nationalism, militarism, Prussianistic Socialism, corporatism, economic nationalism, and a minority emergence of anti-Semitism and esotericism from extreme interpretations of Volkism within the party circle. Volkism aims to transcend common social structures and create a homogeneous community, or Volksgemeinschaft, based on an idea of cultural hegemony. Combined with German expansionism, Volkists sought to unite all historical German territories and acquire additional lands. The term Popular Socialist Nationalism reflects an effort to create a nationalistic narrative of Socialism as an alternative to Marxist Socialism and Market Capitalism. The inclusion of the word "Popular" signifies its appeal to all social strata, regardless of origin or nationality, rather than being limited to workers, peasants, and revolutionaries."

High Tories and their worldview are sometimes at odds with the modernising elements of the Conservative Party. Historically, the late eighteenth-century conservatism derived from the Whig Edmund Burke, Lee Munro and William Pitt the Younger marks a watershed from the "higher" or legitimist Toryism that was allied to Jacobitism. High Toryism has been described as neo-feudalist in its preference for a traditional hierarchical and patriarchal society over modern freedom and equality, as well for holding the traditional gentry as a higher cultural benchmark than the bourgeoisie and those who have attained their position through commerce or labour."

orthodox_nichirenism_subtype: "Orthodox Nichirenism"
orthodox_nichirenism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Orthodox Nichirenism)§!\nThe evolution of Nichirenism began with Tanaka Chigaku, who is considered the father of the movement. He believed that Nichiren Buddhism represented the supreme truth, surpassing all other beliefs on Yamato Island. According to Nichirenism, the principles of Nichiren Buddhism must be followed by everyone, from the emperor to bureaucrats and common people alike. In the Japanese interpretation of the Lotus Sutra, it is held that the Buddha is the supreme being and the center of the universe. Buddha's teachings represent the ultimate truth of the cosmos, with the emperor envisioned as the Marshal of the Holy Armed Forces and the viceroy of Buddha. This emperor would lead the unification of Asia along a righteous and absolute path. Once the world is unified, the Lotus Sutra would be taught in every corner of the globe. Nichirenism was further developed by Inoue Nissho, a preacher and former army spy who had participated in the Xinhai Revolution. Nissho believed he received the ultimate truth from Buddha while taking refuge in an abandoned temple, which motivated him to study Nichiren Buddhism intensively. He joined Chigaku's efforts in promoting Nichirenism and merged it with Pan-Asianism. Nissho believed that Japan was the center of the world, particularly within the Sino-Indosphere, and that the unification of Asia was equivalent to the unification of the world. He asserted that the Lotus Sutra must be propagated from where the sun rises (Japan) to where the sun sets (India), proclaiming that no faith surpasses the Lotus Sutra from the east to the west."
