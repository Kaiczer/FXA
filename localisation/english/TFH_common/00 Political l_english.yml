### Generic Faction Joining ###
generic_events.10.t: "An Alliance with [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]?"
generic_events.10.d: "International relations is often fluid, with agreements and alignments quickly shifting from generation to generation. Sometimes even within a generation, pacts are signed and discarded as interests change. The instability fostered after Black Monday and other political developments around the world has heightened fears in many weaker nations that the great powers coming to blows will catch them in the middle.\n\nWhile some turn to isolation either because of their own domestic turmoil or in hopes that neutrality will make them not worth the time for various powers to prey upon them, [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has taken the opposite approach. With any internal issues now resolved, the people in [FROM.GetNameDefCap] are now looking outwards hoping to find protection alliances provide. We, perhaps due to superior geographic conditions, military power or ideological consistency are [ROOT.GetFactionName]'s choice of ally.\n\nThe question now remains, do we accept them? Another ally in our pact does mean further resources contributed to our combined forces, though any additional dangers they add for our faction is danger that will be taken into common. Any competing claims need to be taken into consideration, and any discord they may cause between faction members. What should be our decision?"
generic_events.10.srd: "An interesting new communique has reached us from [ITA.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]: seeing our current common war against Socialism and our common goal of the betterment of the fatherland, they've elected to propose the elevation of king Amedeo as their head of state, effectively fusing our two countries. Though [ITA_GetNatPopLeader] would remain as head of the Government, our prime minister has been offered senior membership within the ANI and significant sway over military policies."
generic_events.10.a: "Stronger together!"
generic_events.10.b: "A fine proposition, forward it to [THIS.faction_leader.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]!"
generic_events.10.c: "On second thought, no..."

generic_events.11.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Has Accepted!"
generic_events.11.d: "Having heard our request to enter their alliance, [FROM.GetNameDef] has accepted our application and we are now set to become a member of [FROM.GetFactionName]. This will hopefully increase our safety in these troubling times, as we strive to ensure our people's protection from outside powers and foreign meddling.\n\nThat is not to say however this agreement comes for free. We have certain expectations now placed upon us to contribute to the common defence of the nations of [FROM.GetFactionName] and will likely be drawn into conflicts involving this pact. This includes the possibility of being brought into wars initiated by members of this pact.\n\nWe go now into the future together, our fates now intertwined both by words and by force of arms. With any luck, we will gain far more out of this agreement that we have lost in autonomy."
generic_events.11.a: "Excellent!"

generic_events.12.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Proposes an Alliance with [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]"
generic_events.12.d: "An urgent notice has just come in from the foreign office: [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] has asked us to consider bringing [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] into our military alliance. Apparently, [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] originally proposed the idea to [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef], who believed the idea had enough merit to warrant passing to us.\n\nThe benefits are fairly obvious. In strategy, having more forces available is virtually always a good thing, and [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] has acknowledged that it would likely be compelled to participate in all conflicts we may be involved in, regardless of their origin. However, the idea is not without risk — we would be similarly expected to participate in [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]'s wars, and entering an alliance with them may be contrary to our existing strategic aims. Such questions must always be considered when a new alliance is on the table.\n\nAll that being said, what is our decision?"
generic_events.12.a: "Let them join."
generic_events.12.b: "We don't want them."

generic_events.13.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Has Accepted!"
generic_events.13.d: "Good news! After considering [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]'s proposal, [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] has accepted our request to join their alliance. With friends like these, we will surely sleep much safer."
generic_events.13.a: "Excellent."

generic_events.14.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Has Accepted!"
generic_events.14.d: "Good news! After considering our proposal, [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] has agreed to allow [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] into the alliance. We will both surely benefit from the arrangement."
generic_events.14.a: "Excellent."

generic_events.15.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Has Refused!"
generic_events.15.d: "Unfortunate news: despite [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]'s sponsorship, [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] has rejected our offer to join their alliance. It seems that their aims are not as aligned as once thought."
generic_events.15.a: "Their loss."

generic_events.16.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Has Refused!"
generic_events.16.d: "Shocking news: despite our arguing on their behalf, [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] has refused to allow [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] into the alliance. Our foreign office has been caught completely off-guard by this development — they believed our strategic thinking to be much closer than it seems to be."
generic_events.16.a: "What?"

generic_events.17.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Has Refused!"
generic_events.17.d: "Despite our convincing appeals that we could be an effective contributor and member of their alliance, to our chagrin [FROM.GetNameDef] has refused our request to join the [FROM.GetFactionName]. In some ways, this can be expected: alliances are often delicate and wrought with dangers, and some caution is to be expected when making them. Still, this rejection leaves us in a sore spot. Either they have no intentions of defending us or more cynically they see us as a future target on the battlefield.\n\nWe must hurry then to find a working means of national security. Whether this means finding another alliance to shield us from invasion, appealing to multiple factions as a benevolent neutral mediator or whether it means turning inwards to an armed defence, we need to ensure our people's security. The [FROM.GetFactionName] may or may not regret rejecting us, but it is essential that we do not regret this outcome."
generic_events.17.a: "Their loss."

generic_events.18.t: "An Alliance with [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]?"
generic_events.18.d: "International relations is often fluid, with agreements and alignments quickly shifting from generation to generation. Sometimes even within a generation, pacts are signed and discarded as interests change. The instability fostered after Black Monday and other political developments around the world has heightened fears in many weaker nations that the great powers coming to blows will catch them in the middle.\n\nIn an effort to pursue common interests, [FROM.GetFactionName] has banded together into a comprehensive military alliance. They have sought our membership, offering us the potential of further protection (whether from outside threats or from themselves), and in exchange for deepened military and economic ties we will become part of a stronger and united bloc.\n\nJoining however is not without risk. We will likely be drawn into any conflicts that emerge related to this alliance, and it is possible that our contributions will outweigh the benefits we gain from membership. It is essential that as a nation we carefully weigh the costs and benefits of such an agreement."
generic_events.18.a: "Stronger together!"
generic_events.18.b: "On second thought, no..."

generic_events.19.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Has Accepted!"
generic_events.19.d: "After some deliberations, [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has accepted our invitation to join the [ROOT.GetFactionName], as we had dearly hoped they would. A new member of our alliance is generally welcome,bringing further security for each other and at the very least ensuring peace between the members in it. Their contributions of military forces, funding, and diplomatic weight will hopefully advance the mutual interests of [ROOT.GetFactionName], but there are some concerns ahead.\n\nAnother ally in our pact does mean further resources contributed to our combined forces, though any additional dangers they add for our faction is danger that will be taken into common. Any competing claims need to be taken into consideration, and any discord they may cause between faction members.\n\nWe will need to work diligently to ensure that these issues are smoothened over and that this alliance works for everybody (or at the very least, ourselves). Still, this should not dampen the diplomatic victory we have won today for all of our peoples."
generic_events.19.a: "Excellent!"

generic_events.20.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Has Refused!"
generic_events.20.d: "After some deliberation, to our chagrin [FROM.GetNameDef] has rejected our invitation to join the [ROOT.GetFactionName]. Unfortunately this is not an uncommon occurrence when it comes to alliance building. Some nations fear the loss of diplomatic flexibility a formal commitment would make, hoping to avoid being drawn into a losing conflict or wishing to join a more suitable alliance. It is also possible that they have designs that are mutually exclusive with our goals, though hopefully not in antagonistic way.\n\nWhatever the case, [FROM.GetNameDef] will not make or break our alliance. Or at least that should be the case if our faction is to have any weight. We will go on to achieve our goals one way or another, and if they are lucky [FROM.GetNameDef] will not regret their poor decision too much."
generic_events.20.a: "Their loss."

### Incoming War-ning ###
generic_events.30.t: "Prepare for War!"
generic_events.30.d: "We have received numerous reports that [From.GetAdjective] troops are currently massing, and that a great deal of reconnaissance is taking place across the [Root.GetAdjective] border. Military officials say it is clear [From.GetNameDef] is planning an invasion of [Root.GetNameDef], one that could begin anytime within the next several weeks."
generic_events.30.a: "We must get ready!"
generic_events.31.d: "We have received alarming word from [From.GetNameDef] that [From.From.GetAdjective] troops are currently massing, and that a great deal of reconnaissance is taking place across the [From.GetAdjective] border. Military officials say it is clear [From.From.GetNameDef] is planning an invasion of [From.GetNameDef], one that could begin anytime within the next several weeks."
generic_events.32.d: "We have received word from our allies in [From.GetNameDef] that their troops are currently massing, and that a great deal of reconnaissance is taking place across the [attack_target.GetAdjective] border. [From.GetNameDefCap] is planning an invasion of [attack_target.GetNameDef], one that could begin anytime within the next several weeks."

### Ideology Subtype Desc
authoritarian_socialist_subtype_desc: "Authoritarian Socialism, also called statist or totalitarian socialism, is a system where the government has strict control over the economy and society, often limiting political freedoms. The state owns key industries, enforces central planning, and suppresses opposition to maintain power. While these regimes claim to work toward a classless society, power often remains in the hands of a ruling elite. This leads to censorship, restricted freedoms, and government control over many aspects of life."
vanguard_socialist_subtype_desc: "Vanguard Socialism is based on the idea that a small, well-organized group should lead the working class in revolution. This elite group—often a socialist party—guides and educates workers on overthrowing capitalism. The goal is to establish a socialist state where power rests with the working class. However, critics argue that vanguard socialism can lead to authoritarian rule, as power tends to concentrate in the hands of a few."
revolutionary_socialist_subtype_desc: "Revolutionary Socialism rejects gradual reforms and insists that capitalism must be overthrown through mass uprisings or armed struggle. It calls for the collective ownership of resources and the elimination of private property. This ideology opposes imperialism and nationalism, emphasizing global working-class unity. Revolutionary socialism envisions a fair, democratic, and just society free from capitalist exploitation and oppression."
social_democrat_subtype_desc: "Social Democracy is an ideology whose goal is to reform capitalism and humanize it by aligning it with the ethical ideals of social welfare while maintaining the capitalist mode of production, rather than creating an alternative socialist economic system. While usually promoting a plutocratic form of government and a heavily regulated market economy, some more radical streams exist."
social_liberal_subtype_desc: "Social Liberalism is a variation on mainstream classic liberalism, with the main difference being is the inclusion of various civil freedoms as basic human rights. Professing progressive social and economic policies the social liberals aim to create a society where every individual is free to live his own life with full opportunities regardless of their status."
classical_liberal_subtype_desc: "Classical Liberalism champions free markets, individual liberties, and minimal government intervention. Unlike social liberals, classical liberals oppose welfare programs, high taxes, and heavy state control. Their ideas align with 19th-century thinkers like Adam Smith and John Locke, emphasizing economic freedom, natural law, and utilitarianism. While they share some views with conservative liberals, they reject protectionism and excessive government interference. Thinkers like Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises helped shape this ideology, which seeks a balance between economic growth and personal freedom."
social_conservative_subtype_desc: "Social Conservatism is a political ideology which can vary greatly depending on the political history of the region or nation. Nonetheless, it is normally centred on preserving traditional beliefs, attitudes and philosophy as well as the traditional power dynamic of society while using the democratic system. Opposed to both radical and moderate changes to the status quo, conservatives want to keep society in order and stable. Most conservative societies usually promote a regulated market economy and economic protectionism."
authoritarian_subtype_desc: "Authoritarianism is an ideology centered around empowered executive power, giving less importance to parliamentarism and maintaining some partial democratic political system. Authoritarian regimes often take a conservative stance on social issues, favor centralization, and typically have Hawkish sentiments in government; although isolationist branches of this ideology are not unheard of. These regimes aim to maintain national stability and provide the people with both a popular and responsible government."
revolutionary_nationalist_subtype_desc: "Revolutionary Nationalism blends nationalist pride with radical change. Unlike ultranationalists who want to return to a "golden age," revolutionary nationalists aim to reshape their nation, often in response to colonial oppression. They fight for independence and self-rule using various strategies, including political activism, mass protests, or armed struggle. Some movements incorporate socialist ideas, advocating for social justice and economic equality while promoting national unity."
volkist_subtype_desc: "Volkism, or Volkssozialistische Nationalismus, is an authoritarian nationalist ideology that arose during the Conservative Revolution, fueled by the instability of the Weimar system and territorial losses. Blending Prussian-style socialism, corporate statism, and völkisch nationalism, it sought to replace the old order with a "Third Position" ideology that rejected Western ideologies, and Marxist Socialism. Volkists promoted a class-collaborative society where absolute loyalty to the nation was paramount, enforcing strict social order, advocating cultural occultism and mysticism, and state-backed economic control. Advocating social militarism, territorial expansion, and Pan-Nationalist unification, Volkism prioritized national strength over individualism, demanded cultural conformity, and aimed to build a nation-state under a supreme leader’s rule."
paternal_autocrat_subtype_desc: "Paternal Autocracy is not a political ideology in the normal sense of the word, but rather a general term for the attitude that these governments hold towards their citizens: The people are all subjects of the supreme leader, either a king or a dictator, and it is the leader's job and duty to lead the state and society towards the righteous and best path while uniting the people of under his benevolent protection. These countries usually have a very authoritarian government, conservative social views and a state-controlled economy."
reactionary_ultranationalist_subtype_desc: "Reactionary Ultranationalism is an extreme nationalist ideology that longs for a return to traditional values and social structures. It opposes modern political, social, and cultural changes, often promoting national superiority and xenophobia. These movements usually support authoritarian rule, favoring strong leaders or elite governance. Ultranationalists often advocate for expansionist policies and reject dissenting opinions. Historical examples include far-right movements in Europe that push for strict nationalism, ethnic exclusivity, and aggressive foreign policies."
