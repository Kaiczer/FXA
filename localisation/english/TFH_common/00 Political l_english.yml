### Generic Faction Joining ###
 generic_events.10.t: "An Alliance with [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]?"
 generic_events.10.d: "International relations is often fluid, with agreements and alignments quickly shifting from generation to generation. Sometimes even within a generation, pacts are signed and discarded as interests change. The instability fostered after Black Monday and other political developments around the world has heightened fears in many weaker nations that the great powers coming to blows will catch them in the middle.\n\nWhile some turn to isolation either because of their own domestic turmoil or in hopes that neutrality will make them not worth the time for various powers to prey upon them, [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has taken the opposite approach. With any internal issues now resolved, the people in [FROM.GetNameDefCap] are now looking outwards hoping to find protection alliances provide. We, perhaps due to superior geographic conditions, military power or ideological consistency are [ROOT.GetFactionName]'s choice of ally.\n\nThe question now remains, do we accept them? Another ally in our pact does mean further resources contributed to our combined forces, though any additional dangers they add for our faction is danger that will be taken into common. Any competing claims need to be taken into consideration, and any discord they may cause between faction members. What should be our decision?"
 generic_events.10.srd: "An interesting new communique has reached us from [ITA.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]: seeing our current common war against Socialism and our common goal of the betterment of the fatherland, they've elected to propose the elevation of king Amedeo as their head of state, effectively fusing our two countries. Though [ITA_GetNatPopLeader] would remain as head of the Government, our prime minister has been offered senior membership within the ANI and significant sway over military policies."
 generic_events.10.a: "Stronger together!"
 generic_events.10.b: "A fine proposition, forward it to [THIS.faction_leader.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]!"
 generic_events.10.c: "On second thought, no..."

 generic_events.11.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Has Accepted!"
 generic_events.11.d: "Having heard our request to enter their alliance, [FROM.GetNameDef] has accepted our application and we are now set to become a member of [FROM.GetFactionName]. This will hopefully increase our safety in these troubling times, as we strive to ensure our people's protection from outside powers and foreign meddling.\n\nThat is not to say however this agreement comes for free. We have certain expectations now placed upon us to contribute to the common defence of the nations of [FROM.GetFactionName] and will likely be drawn into conflicts involving this pact. This includes the possibility of being brought into wars initiated by members of this pact.\n\nWe go now into the future together, our fates now intertwined both by words and by force of arms. With any luck, we will gain far more out of this agreement that we have lost in autonomy."
 generic_events.11.a: "Excellent!"

 generic_events.12.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Proposes an Alliance with [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]"
 generic_events.12.d: "An urgent notice has just come in from the foreign office: [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] has asked us to consider bringing [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] into our military alliance. Apparently, [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] originally proposed the idea to [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef], who believed the idea had enough merit to warrant passing to us.\n\nThe benefits are fairly obvious. In strategy, having more forces available is virtually always a good thing, and [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] has acknowledged that it would likely be compelled to participate in all conflicts we may be involved in, regardless of their origin. However, the idea is not without risk — we would be similarly expected to participate in [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]'s wars, and entering an alliance with them may be contrary to our existing strategic aims. Such questions must always be considered when a new alliance is on the table.\n\nAll that being said, what is our decision?"
 generic_events.12.a: "Let them join."
 generic_events.12.b: "We don't want them."

 generic_events.13.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Has Accepted!"
 generic_events.13.d: "Good news! After considering [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]'s proposal, [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] has accepted our request to join their alliance. With friends like these, we will surely sleep much safer."
 generic_events.13.a: "Excellent."

 generic_events.14.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Has Accepted!"
 generic_events.14.d: "Good news! After considering our proposal, [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] has agreed to allow [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] into the alliance. We will both surely benefit from the arrangement."
 generic_events.14.a: "Excellent."

 generic_events.15.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Has Refused!"
 generic_events.15.d: "Unfortunate news: despite [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]'s sponsorship, [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] has rejected our offer to join their alliance. It seems that their aims are not as aligned as once thought."
 generic_events.15.a: "Their loss."

 generic_events.16.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Has Refused!"
 generic_events.16.d: "Shocking news: despite our arguing on their behalf, [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] has refused to allow [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] into the alliance. Our foreign office has been caught completely off-guard by this development — they believed our strategic thinking to be much closer than it seems to be."
 generic_events.16.a: "What?"

 generic_events.17.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Has Refused!"
 generic_events.17.d: "Despite our convincing appeals that we could be an effective contributor and member of their alliance, to our chagrin [FROM.GetNameDef] has refused our request to join the [FROM.GetFactionName]. In some ways, this can be expected: alliances are often delicate and wrought with dangers, and some caution is to be expected when making them. Still, this rejection leaves us in a sore spot. Either they have no intentions of defending us or more cynically they see us as a future target on the battlefield.\n\nWe must hurry then to find a working means of national security. Whether this means finding another alliance to shield us from invasion, appealing to multiple factions as a benevolent neutral mediator or whether it means turning inwards to an armed defence, we need to ensure our people's security. The [FROM.GetFactionName] may or may not regret rejecting us, but it is essential that we do not regret this outcome."
 generic_events.17.a: "Their loss."

 generic_events.18.t: "An Alliance with [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]?"
 generic_events.18.d: "International relations is often fluid, with agreements and alignments quickly shifting from generation to generation. Sometimes even within a generation, pacts are signed and discarded as interests change. The instability fostered after Black Monday and other political developments around the world has heightened fears in many weaker nations that the great powers coming to blows will catch them in the middle.\n\nIn an effort to pursue common interests, [FROM.GetFactionName] has banded together into a comprehensive military alliance. They have sought our membership, offering us the potential of further protection (whether from outside threats or from themselves), and in exchange for deepened military and economic ties we will become part of a stronger and united bloc.\n\nJoining however is not without risk. We will likely be drawn into any conflicts that emerge related to this alliance, and it is possible that our contributions will outweigh the benefits we gain from membership. It is essential that as a nation we carefully weigh the costs and benefits of such an agreement."
 generic_events.18.a: "Stronger together!"
 generic_events.18.b: "On second thought, no..."

 generic_events.19.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Has Accepted!"
 generic_events.19.d: "After some deliberations, [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has accepted our invitation to join the [ROOT.GetFactionName], as we had dearly hoped they would. A new member of our alliance is generally welcome,bringing further security for each other and at the very least ensuring peace between the members in it. Their contributions of military forces, funding, and diplomatic weight will hopefully advance the mutual interests of [ROOT.GetFactionName], but there are some concerns ahead.\n\nAnother ally in our pact does mean further resources contributed to our combined forces, though any additional dangers they add for our faction is danger that will be taken into common. Any competing claims need to be taken into consideration, and any discord they may cause between faction members.\n\nWe will need to work diligently to ensure that these issues are smoothened over and that this alliance works for everybody (or at the very least, ourselves). Still, this should not dampen the diplomatic victory we have won today for all of our peoples."
 generic_events.19.a: "Excellent!"

 generic_events.20.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Has Refused!"
 generic_events.20.d: "After some deliberation, to our chagrin [FROM.GetNameDef] has rejected our invitation to join the [ROOT.GetFactionName]. Unfortunately this is not an uncommon occurrence when it comes to alliance building. Some nations fear the loss of diplomatic flexibility a formal commitment would make, hoping to avoid being drawn into a losing conflict or wishing to join a more suitable alliance. It is also possible that they have designs that are mutually exclusive with our goals, though hopefully not in antagonistic way.\n\nWhatever the case, [FROM.GetNameDef] will not make or break our alliance. Or at least that should be the case if our faction is to have any weight. We will go on to achieve our goals one way or another, and if they are lucky [FROM.GetNameDef] will not regret their poor decision too much."
 generic_events.20.a: "Their loss."

### Incoming War-ning ###
 generic_events.30.t: "Prepare for War!"
 generic_events.30.d: "We have received numerous reports that [From.GetAdjective] troops are currently massing, and that a great deal of reconnaissance is taking place across the [Root.GetAdjective] border. Military officials say it is clear [From.GetNameDef] is planning an invasion of [Root.GetNameDef], one that could begin anytime within the next several weeks."
 generic_events.30.a: "We must get ready!"
 generic_events.31.d: "We have received alarming word from [From.GetNameDef] that [From.From.GetAdjective] troops are currently massing, and that a great deal of reconnaissance is taking place across the [From.GetAdjective] border. Military officials say it is clear [From.From.GetNameDef] is planning an invasion of [From.GetNameDef], one that could begin anytime within the next several weeks."
 generic_events.32.d: "We have received word from our allies in [From.GetNameDef] that their troops are currently massing, and that a great deal of reconnaissance is taking place across the [attack_target.GetAdjective] border. [From.GetNameDefCap] is planning an invasion of [attack_target.GetNameDef], one that could begin anytime within the next several weeks."

### Ideology Subtype Desc
authoritarian_socialist_subtype_desc: "Authoritarian Socialism, also known as statist socialism or totalitarian socialism, is a political ideology that advocates for achieving socialism through centralized state control over the economy and society, often with limited political freedoms. In authoritarian socialist systems, the state exercises significant control over the means of production and distribution, typically through nationalization of industries and central planning. These regimes often emphasize the importance of a strong, centralized government to implement socialist policies and to suppress opposition. While authoritarian socialist states claim to aim for a classless society, they often concentrate power in the hands of a ruling elite or a single party, leading to limitations on individual freedoms, censorship, and repression of dissent."
vanguard_socialist_subtype_desc: "Vanguard Socialism is a concept that emerged from Marxist theory and refers to the idea of a revolutionary vanguard or avant-garde leading the proletariat in the struggle for socialism. The vanguard is typically composed of the most class-conscious and politically advanced members of the working class or an organized socialist party. This vanguard is seen as having a clearer understanding of the nature of capitalism, the need for socialist revolution, and the strategies required to achieve it. The vanguard's role is to educate, organize, and mobilize the broader working class, leading them in revolutionary action to overthrow the capitalist system and establish socialism. Vanguard socialism emphasizes the importance of revolutionary leadership and organization in guiding the revolutionary process and preventing it from being co-opted or derailed by bourgeois interests or reformist tendencies. However, critics of vanguard socialism argue that it can lead to authoritarianism, elitism, and the concentration of power in the hands of a few leaders or a single party, potentially undermining the democratic principles of socialism. Notable examples of vanguard socialism include Leninism, which advocated for the establishment of a vanguard party to lead the working class in the Bolshevik Revolution and subsequent construction of socialism in the Soviet Russia."
revolutionary_socialist_subtype_desc: "Revolutionary Socialism is a political ideology advocating for the establishment of socialism through revolutionary means, rejecting the idea that gradual reforms within capitalism can achieve significant social change. It opposes capitalism, advocating for the collective ownership of the means of production and the abolition of private property. Central to its philosophy is the belief in the necessity of the working class seizing political power through mass uprisings or armed struggle, replacing the existing state with one representing the interests of the working class. Emphasizing international solidarity, revolutionary socialism opposes nationalism and imperialism, striving for unity among the global working class. It envisions a socialist society characterized by equality, democracy, and social justice, aiming to eliminate economic exploitation and other forms of oppression inherent in capitalist systems."
social_democrat_subtype_desc: "Social Democracy is an ideology whose goal is to reform capitalism and humanize it by aligning it with the ethical ideals of social welfare while maintaining the capitalist mode of production, rather than creating an alternative socialist economic system. While usually promoting a plutocratic form of government and a heavily regulated market economy, some more radical streams exist."
social_liberal_subtype_desc: "Social Liberalism is a variation on mainstream classic liberalism, with the main difference being is the inclusion of various civil freedoms as basic human rights. Professing progressive social and economic policies the social liberals aim to create a society where every individual is free to live his own life with full opportunities regardless of their status."
classical_liberal_subtype_desc: "As a branch of mainline Liberalism that advocates for a free market and laissez-faire economics, and for civil liberties tied to economic and political freedom under the rule of law of a limited government. Differing from mainline Social Liberalism, Classical Liberals look more negatively on social policies, welfare systems, heavy taxation, and state involvement in the lives of its citizens, instead advocating for deregulation and decentralization, sharing some ideas with Liberal Conservatives, despite despising Conservative economics such as protectionism. Tied to the ‘original’ Liberals of the 19th Century, such as John Locke, Jean-Baptiste Say, Thomas Robert Malthus, and David Ricardo, Classical Liberalism is rooted in the ideas of Adam Smith, standing true to natural law, liberal progress, utilitarianism, and to the lessons learned during the rise of the Industrial Revolution and urbanization. From Hayek to Mises, Classical Liberals tow the line between the Center-Right and the Center-Left, seeking to bring about the ideas of the Enlightenment to their wayward shores."
social_conservative_subtype_desc: "Conservatism is a political ideology which can vary greatly depending on the political history of the region or nation. Nonetheless, it is normally centred on preserving traditional beliefs, attitudes and philosophy as well as the traditional power dynamic of society while using the democratic system. Opposed to both radical and moderate changes to the status quo, conservatives want to keep society in order and stable. Most conservative societies usually promote a regulated market economy and economic protectionism."
authoritarian_subtype_desc: "Authoritarianism is an ideology that combines a strong executive power with a representative parliament and a partial democratic political system. Authoritarian regimes often take a conservative stance on social issues, favour centralization and typically have Hawkish sentiments in-government; although isolationist branches of this ideology are not unheard of. The aim of these regimes is to maintain national stability and provide the people both a popular and responsible government."
revolutionary_nationalist_subtype_desc: "Revolutionary Nationalism is a political ideology that combines nationalist aspirations with revolutionary goals aimed at transforming society. Unlike reactionary ultranationalism, which seeks to preserve or return to a perceived golden age of the nation, revolutionary nationalism often seeks to redefine the nation in a more inclusive or progressive manner. It typically emphasizes the rights, interests, and sovereignty of a particular nation or ethnic group, often in the context of colonial or imperial domination. Revolutionary nationalists advocate for the liberation of their nation from external oppression, whether it be colonial rule, imperialism, or foreign intervention, and may employ various means, including armed struggle, mass mobilization, and political activism, to achieve their goals. Additionally, revolutionary nationalism may incorporate socialist or leftist principles, aiming for social justice, economic equality, and the empowerment of marginalized groups within the nation."
volkist_subtype_desc: "Popular Socialist Nationalism, commonly known as "Volkism," is a newly developed nationalist and revolutionary ideology crafted by German Nationalists. Volkism encompasses various forms of nationalist ideologies that emphasize a master culture, extreme militarism, and an authoritarian-to-totalitarian corporative one-party state. In this system, individuals are subordinated to the master culture, which is considered the central value of life. Unlike existing revolutionary nationalist schools, Volkism advocates for an absolute form of a multi-cultural society where all other cultures are devalued in importance. The master culture is prioritized in all aspects of life, and the state's mission is to expand its hegemony and glory, brutally suppressing any disobedience when necessary. Volkism schools commonly share a deep hatred of Western democracy, capitalism, Marxist socialism, and market liberalism. They believe that people should be subordinate to a single national institution that represents all social strata, regardless of origin or nationality, as long as they adhere to the values of Volkism. This ideology promotes the idea of dedicating everything to the nation, forever and always."
paternal_autocrat_subtype_desc: "Paternal Autocracy is not a political ideology in the normal sense of the word, but rather a general term for the attitude that these governments hold towards their citizens: The people are all subjects of the leader, either a king or a dictator, and it is the leader's job and duty to lead the state and society towards the righteous and best path while uniting the people of under his benevolent protection. These countries usually have a very authoritarian government, conservative social views and a state-controlled economy."
reactionary_ultranationalist_subtype_desc: "Reactionary Ultranationalism is a political ideology marked by extreme nationalism and a nostalgic longing for a perceived idealized past, often coupled with a vehement rejection of modern social, cultural, or political changes. Advocates of this ideology typically seek to preserve or restore traditional values, hierarchies, and social structures, viewing them as essential to the identity and strength of their nation or ethnic group. Ultranationalists promote a sense of superiority and exclusivity, often advocating for aggressive or expansionist foreign policies and exhibiting xenophobic or racist attitudes towards outsiders and minority groups. These movements often gravitate towards authoritarianism, championing strong leadership or a ruling elite, and may employ tactics of repression and intolerance towards dissenting voices. Examples of reactionary ultranationalist movements in Europe, contemporary far-right movements, and certain forms of ethnonationalism."
