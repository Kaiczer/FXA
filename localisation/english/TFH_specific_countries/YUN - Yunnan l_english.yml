YUN_reactionary_ultranationalist_party_long: "Minority Nationalists\n§gYunnan Province is home to dozens of ethnic groups and religious beliefs, its frontiers have long been an untamed, rebellious backwater that the Kunming administration has struggled to suppress. The various tribes, chieftains and religious sects have long felt that their ways of life were under attack from China's Han and Manchu elites. With the legacy of great wars like the Panthay Rebellion still looming over the province, it would not take much to provoke the tribes to take action, especially if they sense a moment of weakness from Kunming.§!"
