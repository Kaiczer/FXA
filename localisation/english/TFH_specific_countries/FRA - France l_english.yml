#### Political Parties ####
FRA_authoritarian_socialism_party: "PFNC"
FRA_authoritarian_socialism_party_long: "Parti Français National Communiste                        §gA fringe political movement in France, the PFNC was formed during the February 1934 riots as a far-left split of Parti Populaire Français, which itself was a breakaway of the Parti Communiste Français. The party soon asserted itself as the most radical of the leftist parties in France, supporting racist doctrine refusing to cooperate with the government in any way. The party supports both Rattachism and pan-European nationalism, seeking to unify Europe under a single centralized government with the French at the top calling the shot. Despite being an extreme party, the PFNC is highly antagonistic towards the Parti Populaire Français and other radicals on both the left and right. The original leader of the PFNC, Marcel Déat, has shown to have highly radical opinions even by the standards of the party, and some have even branded him as a lover of Dressler's Germany. Should the PFNC come to power, France may find herself devoid of allies and with enemies on all sides.§!"
FRA_vanguard_socialism_party: "PCF"
FRA_vanguard_socialism_party_long: "Parti Communiste Français                                   §gThe Parti Communiste Français is the mainline Communist party presently active in France. Originally formed as a more radical offshoot of the SFIO in late 1920, the PCF quickly became the primary communist organization in France during the 20s and 30s, gaining great influence within the working class and having the power to call strikes at will, even if said strikes were few and far between. The PCF has affirmed itself as a revolutionary party and even included people such as Nguyen Sinh Cung, who was in fact one of its founding members. The party has steadily gained popularity throughout the early 19th Century, and polls show that support for the PCF is higher than ever due to the resurgent German power in the East and expanding Soviet influence across Europe. Maurice Thorez, the parties leader, is an outspoken communist with ties to the government and much political experience.Many believe that if leftism were to come to France, the PCF would be the vanguard and the one's taking charge of the political situation.§!"
FRA_revolutionary_socialism_party: "Anarchistes"
FRA_revolutionary_socialism_party_long: "Mouvement Anarchiste Français                             §gA collection of Anarchists and libertarian socialist movements led by Sébastien Faure under a common banner, the Anarchistes wish to see a great degree of decentralization come to France and a peaceful, democratic transition to revolution. While the Anarchiste movement may be small in number and low in popularity, they may prove invaluable in the case of a leftist government coming to power in France, democratically or otherwise.§!"
FRA_social_democracy_party: "SFIO"
FRA_social_democracy_party_long: "Section Française de l'Internationale Ouvrière         §gThe SFIO was born out of a merger between the Socialist Party of France and the French Socialist party in 1905 under pressure of the Second Internationale, and quickly found themselves sandwiched between the radical working-class vanguard_socialisms and middle-class liberals under the banner of the Radical Party. The SFIO was weakened not long after their creation when members of the Confédération générale du travail refused to cooperate with the party due to them being seen as radicals. These members of the CGT would form the Parti républicain-socialiste in the years leading up to the Great War, but would find themselves unable to stay afloat whilst trying to uphold both socialist and reformist policies, and the party would be be destroyed in 1934 with many of its members rejoining the SFIO. The outbreak of the Great War saw futher divide in the party as members argued between pacifism and patriotism. The post-war domination of French politics by the Fédération Républicaine kept the SFIO out of the spotlight, but the upcoming elections may prove to be their greatest chance yet of achieving success.§!"
FRA_social_liberalism_party: "PR"
FRA_social_liberalism_party_long: "Parti Républicain, Radical et Radical-Socialiste     §gBorn shortly after the turn of the Century in 1901, the PR is the foremost of the radicalist democratic parties presently operating in France. Originally quite left leaning, the PR has gradually moved futher towards the center with the rising popularity of the SFIO capturing the hearts and minds of the workers and labourors of France. After the Great War, the PR participated in minor government roles whilst being constantly overshadowed by the FR-AD coalition government which dominated French politics during the 20s and 30s. Popular support for the PR has never been large, and they must work together with other larger parties in order to push their agenda, but a coalition government involving the PR would certainly be a drastic change from the status quo.§!"
FRA_classical_liberalism_party: "AD"
FRA_classical_liberalism_party_long: "Alliance Démocratique                                       §gCreated in 1901 as a splinter of the Parti Républicain, the AD was a large supporter of the Bloc des gauches from 1899 to 1906. The AD distinguished itself from the right by supporting the 1905 Seperation of State and Church Act, something which many of the right-leaning parties had opposed due to their pro-Catholic policies. The party was formalized in 1911 under the name "Parti Démocratique Républicain". The AD made a transition to the right in the years leading up to and including the Great War, and in 1919 they formed the Bloc National in cooperation with the Fédération Républicaine. This coalition proved to be highly successful, and the postwar economic boom that the French economy experienced further solidified their popularity with the French people. This "blue wave" was more beneficial to the FR than the AD, but both parties remained dominant in French politics up to 1936.§!"
FRA_social_conservatism_party: "FR"
FRA_social_conservatism_party_long: "Fédération Républicaine                                          §gThe FR was fromed in 1903 in an attempt to unite conservatives in France who opposed the Bloc des gauches as well as partially the defense of Jewish officer Alfred Dreyfus, the party made up the conservative bourgeoisie of France who were generally opposed to social reform and supportive of minor decentralization throughout the country. The formation of the Bloc National in 1919 was a breakthrough for the previously minor party, and they soon came to dominate the French elections all throughout the 1920s and 30s. Almost every single French Prime Minister during this time came from the FR, with only a select few belonging to the AD, leading to little social change taking place. This lack of change has gradually pushed more and more of the French people towards the PR, yet support for the Bloc National remains high. Some believe that it would take nothing short of a devestating scandal to shatter the FR's popularity.§!"
FRA_paternalism_party: "PSF"
FRA_paternalism_party_long: "Parti Social Français                                                 §gA nationalist French party in early 1936 and can trace its origins to the far-right political league known as the Croix-de-Feu, which was itself only founded in 1927. The Croix-de-Feu supported the ideas of François de La Rocque, which served as the league's ceremonial leader. The sitting government attempted to ban all of the leagues after the February 1934 riots, but due to the league's influences in the already right-leaning government, the act failed and the leagues were allowed to continue their operation unimpeded. The Croix-de-Feu's reorganization into an political party took place shortly after the attempt to ban it and the other leagues failed in late 1935, and by 1936 they had transformed themselves into the PSF. The transition from pressure league to political party saw them drift further from the radical far-right and more towards the moderate right, yet they still uphold nationalist and patriotic French values whilst upholding democratic traditions and being fiercely opposed to communism.§!"
FRA_despotism_party: "Gouvernement militaire"
FRA_despotism_party_long: "Gouvernement militaire                                           §gSupport for a military junta is limited to radicals within the military, and the only possibility of a military junta taking power would be in the event of total government collapse and the need for a powerful force to fill the power vacuum.§!"
FRA_ultrareactionism_party: "PPF"
FRA_ultrareactionism_party_long: "Parti Populaire Français                                          §gEasily the most radical of France's right-leaning parties, the PPF upholds extreme nationalism, racist rhetoric, and privatization of industries. The PPF was created mainly from members of the PCF who found a disdain for the PFNC's policies and were generally dissatisfied with the left's failure in recent decades. The PPF is outspokenly anti-communist and uses iconography and symbolism to gather support, most of which is based just North of Paris. The PPF has little support in the French political sphere, and not even the equally radial PFNC are willing to cooperate with the party. As such, it will take nothing more than a total collapse of not only the French government but the state itself for the PPF to assert their dominance at the top of the political food chain.§!"
FRA_volkism_party: "SF"
FRA_volkism_party_long: "Solidarité Française                                          §gFrance's only Valkist movement, the Solidarité Française have virtually no internal support outside of some Germans living in Alsace-Lorraine and the Sarre. Many in French politics believe that the SF are openly working against the French state in order to bring about a collaberationist regime which is submissive to Germany. The SF has no real centralized leadership and is only united in their unique ideology which differs greatly from all others on the spectrum.§!"
