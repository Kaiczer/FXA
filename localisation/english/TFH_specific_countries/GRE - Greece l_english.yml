#### Political Parties ####
GRE_volkism_party: "ESKE"
GRE_volkism_party_long: "Ethnikón Sosialistikón Kómma Elládos (Hellenic National Socialist Party) \n§gEstablished in Athens in December 1932, the party emerged after Merkouris who had previously shown sympathy to German Volkish trade unions, split from Dimitrios Gounaris and the Populist Party over the need to lean towards reformism. Fiercely supportive of Valkism, the Hellenic National Socialist Party seeks to copy its German counterpart in organizational and policy terms, but offer an unique version of Valkism in which it would seek to “restore National Unity, Social Solidarity and Discipline as a means of achieving the fuller moral and material well-being of the people”.§!"
GRE_authoritarian_socialism_party: "KAKE"
GRE_authoritarian_socialism_party_long: "Kommounistikó Archeiomarxistikó Kómma Elládas (Communist Archeio-Marxist Party of Greece) \n§gThe Communist Archeio-Marxist Party of Greece is a communist political party in Greece, active from 1934. It belongs to a subgenre of Marxism–Leninism and Trotskyism known as Archeio-Marxism (Archive-Marxism) and appears to have been the last scion of that ideology. Its leader, Dimitrios Giotopoulos, also known by his primary alias "Witte", is the leader of the KAKE. Before its formation, he had been a leader of the Greek Archeio-Marxists, which had been one of the by far largest dissident communist movements in Greece during the early-to-mid-1930s, as members of Leon Trotsky's "Left Opposition". KAKE split from Trotsky's movement in 1934 after significant ideological fallout. While overshadowed by the major Communist Party, KAKE continues its activites as it waits for the proper moment to assert itself as the true successor of socialism, even though rumors claim that Giotopoulos is collaborating with the right.§!"

GRE_social_conservatism_party_long: "Laïkón Kómma (People's Party) \n§gThe People's Party is considered the main force of Conservatism in Hellas.

Founded in 1920, Gounaris and his parliamentary candidates campaigned for the withdrawal of the Hellenic Army from Asia Minor, which it occupied under the terms of the Treaty of Sèvres in the aftermath of World War I. Failing to win the 1920 election against the Venizelists and the subsequent victory in the Greco-Turkish war, the party suffered great losses and was in the brink of dissolution, only saved through Gounaris' political maneuvering. Abandonding its monarchist allegiance and adapting a more reformist stance, its aims are to preserve Hellas and its traditions through status-quo policies.§!"
