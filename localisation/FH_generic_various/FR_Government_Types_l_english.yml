 gov.1.t: "The Breakdown of the [Root.GetName]"
 gov.1.d: "A series of abrupt and drastic societal changes has strained our government's ability to react and to keep our nation stable or even functioning properly. With the [Root.GetAdjective] government unable to to perform the actions and duties expected of it many of our people have begun to look towards the black market and other such illegal organizations to satisfy their needs. In light of our government's public weakness political agitators ranging from labor organizations to opposition parties have begun to hold protests and question our administration's legitimacy. If it wasn't for the loyalty of the [Root.GetAdjective] army many fear that the [Root.GetName] may collapse into a civil war. If we are to reverse this impending disaster we must implement major reforms to improve our country's internal stability."
 gov.1.a: "May God help us all"
 
 gov.2.t: "Stability returns to the [Root.GetName]"
 gov.2.d: "As our government implements much needed reforms it seems a sense of stability is returning to our country. While the worst may be over it's clear that our opposition will be watching us closely. We can not afford to face the brink of disaster like this ever again."
 gov.2.a: "Order has been restored"
