revolutionary_showaist_subtype: "Revolutionary Showaism"
revolutionary_showaist_subtype_desc: "§Y(Revolutionary Showaism)§!\n\nSince the present emperor ascended to the Chrysanthemum throne, the Japanese Empire has experienced a significant decline. The economy has reached a critical point, and the immigration of Koreans, along with the liberal impurity in Japanese politics, has only fueled the inspiration of right-wing extremists. Led by militarist advocates and the generals of the Imperial Armed Forces on Yamato Island, their only goal is to purify the island and secure it from the corrupted Western ideology once and for all.\n\nUnder the banner of Showa restoration, the far-right has embraced nationalistic and other right-wing ideas from Europe, but with a twist of socialism. This has led to the creation of Showaism, an ideology that aims to purify the Japanese Empire. Hashimoto Kingoro, a Japanese officer and one of Showaism's advocates, believes that the combination of revolutionary socialism, stratocracy, and nationalism will cleanse Japanese politics and bureaucracy of the corrupted liberalism. All of this will be done in the name of fairness and equality, based on his interpretation of socialism. The military will serve as the protector of the new reformed Japanese bureaucracy to ensure and safeguard the new Japan from another wave of corruption."
autocratic_socialist_subtype: "Autocratic Socialism"
autocratic_socialist_subtype_desc: "§Y(Autocratic Socialism)§!\n\nAutocratic Socialist regimes are highly authoritarian dictatorships that (at least on paper) adhere to socialist principles. They are notably varied, but can usually be seen with some form of command economy, emphasis on militarism, are often nationalist or use patriotism as a tool of the state, and are frequently at odds with more mainline Charter Totalists. While their commitment to Socialist revolutionary principles is usually questionable at best, these regimes still maintain socialism as the official state ideology, and go to lengths to paint their government red - even if the government is nothing short of a total dictatorship."

monsoc_subtype: "Monarcho-Socialism"
monsoc_subtype_desc: "§Y(Monarcho-Socialism)§!\n\nMonarcho-Socialism, along with its various subtypes such as Monarcho-Bolshevism, Monarcho-Communism, and others, seeks to coherently fuse the typically opposed systems of Socialism and Monarchism into one, unified form of government. Though the degree to which each monarch is dedicated to the Socialist system can vary greatly, from mere figureheads painted Red to monarchs fully dedicated to the Socialist cause, each system holds in common an adherence to the noble system of monarchism, and though this monarch is frequently only a facade for a more traditional Socialist government, their presence is key to the wider system. Under these Red monarchies, the journey to true Socialism is shepherded, and though each system is incredibly varied, they usually hold in common a more conservative or traditionalist outlook on social and societal issues."
leninism_subtype: "Leninism"
leninism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Leninism)§!\n\nLeninism is a political ideology developed by Vladimir Lenin, which advocates for the establishment of a revolutionary vanguard party to lead the working class in overthrowing capitalism. It emphasizes the need for a centralized and disciplined party structure, guided by Marxist principles, to seize and maintain state power on behalf of the working class. Leninism also promotes the idea of a transitional socialist state, referred to as the \"dictatorship of the proletariat,\" as a means to suppress counter-revolutionary forces and lay the groundwork for a future communist society."

libsoc_utopian_socialism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Utopian Socialism)§!\n\nUtopian socialism is seen as an ideology that is misguided in its attempts to create a perfect society through centralized planning and government control, Libertarians generally believe in the importance of individual liberty and see the government as a potential threat to these values.\n\nOn the other hand, Utopian socialism often involves the idea of a collective ownership of the means of production and a planned economy, which may be seen as incompatible with individual freedom and the principles of a free market. Libertarians would argue that such an approach would restrain innovation, limit consumer choice, and result in inefficiencies and waste."
anarcho_syndicalism_subtype: "Anarcho-Syndicalism"
anarcho_syndicalism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Anarcho-Syndicalism)§!\n\nThe largest subset of mainline Orthodox Syndicalism, Anarcho-Syndicalism seeks to build a Syndicalist system - that is, a system organized around trade unions and employee organizations - within an Anarchist and stateless, or semi-stateless, framework. Seeking to abolish the wage system as well as Capitalist-fueled statism, Anarcho-Syndicalists believe that through solidarity, self-management, communization, direct action, and direct democracy, a true egalitarian paradise can be built for all to enjoy. Rejecting private property, hierarchies, and social stratification, Anarcho-Syndicalists will tear down the state to build their unionist utopias free from the apparent greed of statism."
socialist_feminist_subtype: "Socialist Feminism"
socialist_feminist_subtype_desc: "§Y(Socialist Feminism)§!\n\nThe focus of Socialist Feminism is that all women should be liberated and the patriarchy should be overthrown. It encompasses a wide range of progressive and liberal ideas in the market with a free one for all people, and that oppression of the common person should be forbidden. They also think that every man, woman, and child should be equal and free under a society with no one over or under the rest."
agrarian_socialism_subtype: "Agrarian Socialism"
agrarian_socialism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Agrarian Socialism)§!\n\nAgrarian Socialism is the attempt to fuse Agrarian principles with Socialist doctrine. Championed by the likes of Zapata or the Narodniks, Agrarian Socialists are frequently more Conservative than their Leftist allies and push for a Socialist system that puts the peasantry and the farmers of the state above all other concerns. Common in less-developed or under-industrialized nations, Agrarian Socialism is frequently democratic, and usually calls for the creation of farming cooperatives, communes, or other cooperative organizational structures to better increase agricultural output and efficiency while progressing towards true Socialism."
bukharinist_subtype: "Bukharinism"
bukharinist_subtype_desc: "§Y(Bukharinism)§!\n\nBukharinism or Semi-Market Socialism is a set of ideas formulated by the Russian Bolshevik Nikolai Bukharin after the Civil War in Russia, which formed the basis of the program of his People's Socialist Party and the rationale for the so-called New Economic Policy.\n\nBukharin considered the main culprit for the failure of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and the loss of the Reds in the Civil War to be the ineffective policy of \"War communism\", which led to the complete alienation of the peasants from the Bolsheviks and economic crisis. Bukharin, however, in his writings, developed with economist Nikolai Kondratiev, suggested that socialism should be achieved gradually - and that state regulation of a mixed economy using planned and market mechanisms was necessary to achieve this goal. \"Socialism in the city - Capitalism in the countryside\" was how Bukharin characterized his program at the founding congress of the new party. In addition to the economic sphere, Bukharinism proposes a multiparty form of Soviet democracy, separation of powers, and Korenization - support for national minorities by promoting national human resources and limiting Russification."

Though this status quo varies from nation to nation, Centrists rally around this middleground just the same, seeking to balance equality and hierarchy in their varied societies. Hated by both conservatives and extremists who see them as fence-sitters, Centrists rally around the proven status quo without faltering, resisting rapid reform and staunch traditionalism just the same as they pursue a happy medium between bickering parties for the greater good of their societies as they seek stability and consistency above all."

radical_liberalism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Radical Liberalism)§!\n\nRadical Liberalism - also called Classical Radicalism or Radical Republicanism - describes the modern political movements chiefly inspired by the Radicals of the French Revolution and the precursor Liberals of the past century. Associated with Republicanism, modernism, civic nationalism, rationalism, secular humanism, progressivism, and more, Radical Liberal seeks to stretch the meaning of what it means to be ‘Liberal’ in order to build a truly free, fair, and egalitarian society that champions freedom, liberty, and justice for all."

Split between groups that support deregulation and the free market, and those that instead support economic interventionism, these groups are united in their pursuit of civil liberties and freedoms while championing Conservative social positions. Overall, Liberal Conservatism fuses Liberal Capitalism and Social Justice with Traditionalist views on society and life, and is exceedingly common in the Western World specifically, though it can be seen in practice across the globe."

christian_democracy_subtype: "Christian Democracy"
christian_democracy_subtype_desc: "§Y(Christian Democracy)§!\n\nChristian Democratic movements understand that only through allowing people a choice, and not coercion, a religious society might be upheld. Basing its programmes on Catholic social teaching and neo-Calvinism, Christian Democrats strive to create a free society in which traditional family values, social justice and good old fashioned patriotism will be respected. While most Christian Democratic parties don't exclude any denomination, some might choose to keep to a strictly anti-ecumenical position. Surprisingly to some, many advocates for Christian Democracy are rather left leaning in their views on the economy, advocating for models such as Distributism, based on Pope Leo XIII's 'Rerum novarum' encyclical. That position is of course not the only choice, with others preaching the Prosperity Gospel or upholding Christian Capitalism."
soccon_warlordism_subtype: "Conservative Warlordism"
soccon_warlordism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Conservative Warlordism)§!\n\nWarlordism is hardly a uniform ideology by any stretch of the imagination. Instead, it describes the varied, incoherent, disorganized, and militarist nature of various warlord cliques around the world, and was named after the Warlord Period of China in which the term became popularized in the modern context. Ranging from bandit groups with a state to organized military startocracies to even military-backed republican governments or pure dictatorships, Warlordism has less to do with politics and more to do with a lack of clear borders and the ever-present and often chaotic nature of warfare. Warlordism is frequently a transitory state, and is usually just a stepping stone on the road to a more clearly defined political system, though some pure warlord states do exist."

Depending on where it has formed and the conditions it formed under, a police-run nation can be political or apolitical, professional or unprofessional, corrupt or virtuous - all to varying degrees - but despite this ideological fluidity, they all share a baseline desire to control an otherwise unruly and chaotic society. Similar to military juntas but usually less militaristic and imperialistic, Police States seek to bring order to their people above all other pursuits, and with the Law on their side, they can do so with impunity."

klan_nationalism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Klan Nationalism)§!\n\nKlan Nationalism is a generic name of the White Supremacist ideology esposed by the American Ku Klux Klan. Varied in its approach to how it handles issues concerning race and ethnicity, the varied sects of the Klan all agree on one thing - White is right. From supporting Back to Africa plans to advocating to a total return the slavery, the ideas of the Klan are varied and diverse, but they can all agree that piety, nationalism, white supremacism, American exceptionalism, and militarism are all Godly pursuits."

panasian_nichirenist_subtype: "Pan-Asian Nichirenism"
panasian_nichirenist_subtype_desc: "§Y(Pan-Asian Nichirenism)§!\n\nThe evolution of Nichirenism began with Tanaka Chigaku, the father of Nichirenism, who believed that Nichiren Buddhism is the supreme truth, above all other beliefs in Yamato Island. The logos of Nichirenism must be followed by everyone, from the Emperor to bureaucrats and even common people. In the Japanese interpretation of the Lotus Sutra, it is believed that the Buddha is the only supreme being and even the center of the universe. Buddha's logos represent the supreme truth of the universe, and the Emperor will become the Marshal of the Holy Armed Forces and the viceroy of Buddha. He will guide the unification of Asia on the right and absolute path. After the world has been unified, the Lotus Sutra shall be taught in every corner of the world.\n\nLater, Nichirenism was further developed by Inoue Nissho, a preacher and former army spy who joined the Xinhai Revolution. He believed that he received the truth from Buddha while taking refuge in an abandoned temple and was motivated to study Nichiren Buddhism. He joined Chigaku's association in teaching Nichirenism and developed Pan-Asianism and Nichirenism together. He believed that Japan was the center of the world, specifically the Sino-Indosphere, and the unification of Asia was equal to unification of the world. The Lotus Sutra must be spread from where the sun was risen (Japan) and the sun was set (India), and there is no faith that is above the Lotus Sutra from west to east."

occultism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Esotericism)§!\n\nEsoteric Nationalism, also called Occultist Nationalism or Esotericism, is a diverse subset of far-Right ideologies bound together by their shared emphasis on outsider philosophies, religions, and other estranged ideas or movements. Often tied to Paganism, the Occult, or to fringe ideas like Theosophy and Ariosophy, these syncretic movements combine Nationalist fervor with their chosen motif or aesthetic, and seek to rebuild society completely along the lines of their proclaimed dogma."
val_legionarism_subtype: "Legionarism"
val_legionarism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Legionarism)§!\n\nFirst popularized by the Iron Guard of Romania, the Black Hundreds in Russia, and the ANI in Italy, Legionarism is a form of a highly religious and deeply militarist revolutionary nationalism. Rejecting entrenched political elites though sometimes tied to monarchism, Legionaries or Legionarists advocate for a national revolution that would end the old order and usher in the creation of a new, spiritually reborn society. Members of Legionary parties are often trained to act as militant martyrs in order to become closer to their Nation and God, though less extreme examples exist where Nationalism and Patriotism are expressed far more than martyrdom. In terms of economics, there is no one defined view, although Capitalism and Socialism are usually outright rejected as a corrupting, foreign force, with Corporatism, Right Syndicalism, or other forms of controlled economics largely being dominant. Though the emphasis on religion and zealotry widely differs, most Legionarists are devoutly Catholic or Christian, depending on the nation of origin, and all are deeply devoted to the jingoistic revitalization of their native country."
venizelism_subtype: "Venizelism"
venizelism_subtype_desc: "Venizelism is one of the most significant political movements in Greece since the start of the 20th centrury. During the period of 1910 to 1922, when Greece was in a state of continuous military readiness, a new political mindset emerged, embodied by Eleftherios Venizelos, and was commonly referred to as Venizelism. It is difficult to define in what exactly this political ideology was, but in terms of the economy, Venizelism considered the Greek state as a lever for the expression and development of Hellenism. In other words, the Greek state had to pursue the integration of Hellenism beyond its borders and, with a unified national and state identity, claim its place in the then-modern world. This required not only institutional modernization to make the state efficient and reliable but also a general commitment to the idea of developing the nation's productive forces."
