FINESTHOUR_CAREER_PROFILE: "The Finest Hour"

### Name and Description
BM_HISTORY_TITLE: "Brief History"
FINESTHOUR_NAME: "Legacy of the Great War"
FINESTHOUR_DESC: "The end of the Great War saw the empires of the old—the Ottomans, the Austrians, and the Germans—fall greatly in both power and influence while the United States, Britain, and France have risen. While the Great War was thought by many to usher in a new era of peace, it seems that the tensions of old have not yet faded away and, with them, could threaten the tenuous peace that remains..."
OTHER_FINESTHOUR_DESC: "It is 1936, and the world is on a brink of a new, inevitable, war. But the world is made up of more than a few monolithic empires. The smallest stones can bring about tidal waves, and these lesser states can bring about much change. Will you side with the valkists? Will you carry on the torch of the revolution? Or maybe you will grant your people true freedom, the likes of which they have never seen? The world will soon derail from its peaceful existance, plummeting into the hells of war. And it will not wait for your decisions."

### Intro Event
intro.1.t: "The Finest Hour Build 0.1.11 (Arise from Ashen Flame)"
intro.1.d: "After nearly quite sometime of waiting, we are overjoyed to annouce that version 0.1.11 has finally been released to the public! In this version you will find many changes throughout the globe; Ukraine and Japan have both been reworked, new focus icons have been added, tweaked trees and new fresh portraits have been inserted, Alexander's path has been fixed, Finland received some small love, the UK has received some minor content, and various improvements to the map in preparation for future updates have all been done.\nUnfortunately, we had to remove Turkish content temporarily, to resolve compatibility issues, but rest assured that Turkey is being worked on by the team, and it's rework will be ready soon! \n\nThis mod is continually worked on by a dedicated team of volunteers from around the globe, and we all greatly appreciate your kind words and time spent enjoying the content that we have created. From the bottom of our hearts, you all have our most sincere thanks!"
intro.1.a: "Thanks!"
intro.1.b: "What's up with Party Popularity?"
intro.1.c: "Is there an FAQ anywhere?"
intro.2.t: "The Finest Hour FAQ"
intro.2.d: "Q; (Nation) is pretty bad. Will it be getting a rework?\nA; Yes, all nations are intended to get a rework at some point in time. Nothing here is permanent.\n\nQ; Will (Nation) get content in the future?\nA; Our goal, similar to Kaiserreich, is for all nations to eventually recieve content. Now, the time until that's accomplished? You can bet it's going to be quite some time; we're only humans after all.\n\nQ; Will DLCs (such as WtT) be a requirement for The Finest Hour?\nA; Absolutely not. While The Finest Hour will make good use of the new features added in official expansions we will not make it mandatory for Players to buy the DLCs to play the mod.\n\nQ; What country will receive content next?\nA; The next country that receives content (for 0.12) will probably be Hellas.\n\nQ;I'd like to join the team as an Artist/Coder/Tester/Writer! Where do I sign up?\nA; Great to hear! You'll have to join our Discord Server and fill out the respective application. We've got links to the discord on our Steam Workshop page and Subreddit, however if you're a masochist and would prefer to type the invite out manually; it's right here: https://discord.gg/dVT7bHNVgY"
intro.2.a: "Why doesn't anybody ever let me keep that PP?"
intro.3.t: "Party Popularity and You"
intro.3.d: "The Finest Hour uses Kaiserreich's minister system, and obviously borrows from KR heavily in multiple other areas. One such example is the popularity system. \n\nKaiserreich's popularity system entails more notable Political Power gain for nations that have more popular parties, in an attempt to represent civil content with the regime or parliamentary majorities in democratic systems. Generally, higher popularity means that PP Gain will also be higher. The following is the Criteria for the various popularity levels. \n\nVery Low Popularity = Less than 20% Popularity for the ruling Party\nLow Popularity = 20% - 40% Popularity for the ruling Party\nMedium Popularity = 40% - 60% Popularity for the ruling Party\nHigh Popularity = 60% - 80% Popularity for the ruling Party\nVery High Popularity = More than 80% Popularity for the ruling Party\n\nNow, we said 'Generally, higher popularity means that PP Gain will also be higher' for a reason. Nations such as France have their popularity system disabled in order to properly simulate their coalition-based gameplay (or for other reasons entirely). Just be sure to keep this in mind and you should be smooth-sailing when playing nations with their party popularity system disabled!"
intro.3.a: "So, nearly nothing has changed?"
intro.4.t: "News events!"
intro.4.d: "Hello there! Similar to Kaiserreich, the world of Führerreich relies heavily on news events in order to feel alive and interesting. Ultimately, there's the possibility that you may not apperciate this though, and would prefer to turn it off to reduce event-spam.\n\nBecause of the aforementioned reasons, we're going to need you to select a preference for World News events before we let you out of this event chain."
intro.4.a: "I'd prefer to see all News Events"
intro.4.b: "Only the important ones"
intro.4.c: "News Events are for LOSERS"

### Ideology Subtype Desc
authoritarian_socialist_subtype_desc: "Authoritarian Socialism, also known as statist socialism or totalitarian socialism, is a political ideology that advocates for achieving socialism through centralized state control over the economy and society, often with limited political freedoms. In authoritarian socialist systems, the state exercises significant control over the means of production and distribution, typically through nationalization of industries and central planning. These regimes often emphasize the importance of a strong, centralized government to implement socialist policies and to suppress opposition. While authoritarian socialist states claim to aim for a classless society, they often concentrate power in the hands of a ruling elite or a single party, leading to limitations on individual freedoms, censorship, and repression of dissent."
vanguard_socialist_subtype_desc: "Vanguard Socialism is a concept that emerged from Marxist theory and refers to the idea of a revolutionary vanguard or avant-garde leading the proletariat in the struggle for socialism. The vanguard is typically composed of the most class-conscious and politically advanced members of the working class or an organized socialist party. This vanguard is seen as having a clearer understanding of the nature of capitalism, the need for socialist revolution, and the strategies required to achieve it. The vanguard's role is to educate, organize, and mobilize the broader working class, leading them in revolutionary action to overthrow the capitalist system and establish socialism. Vanguard socialism emphasizes the importance of revolutionary leadership and organization in guiding the revolutionary process and preventing it from being co-opted or derailed by bourgeois interests or reformist tendencies. However, critics of vanguard socialism argue that it can lead to authoritarianism, elitism, and the concentration of power in the hands of a few leaders or a single party, potentially undermining the democratic principles of socialism. Notable examples of vanguard socialism include Leninism, which advocated for the establishment of a vanguard party to lead the working class in the Bolshevik Revolution and subsequent construction of socialism in the Soviet Russia."
revolutionary_socialist_subtype_desc: "Revolutionary Socialism is a political ideology advocating for the establishment of socialism through revolutionary means, rejecting the idea that gradual reforms within capitalism can achieve significant social change. It opposes capitalism, advocating for the collective ownership of the means of production and the abolition of private property. Central to its philosophy is the belief in the necessity of the working class seizing political power through mass uprisings or armed struggle, replacing the existing state with one representing the interests of the working class. Emphasizing international solidarity, revolutionary socialism opposes nationalism and imperialism, striving for unity among the global working class. It envisions a socialist society characterized by equality, democracy, and social justice, aiming to eliminate economic exploitation and other forms of oppression inherent in capitalist systems."
social_democrat_subtype_desc: "Social Democracy is an ideology whose goal is to reform capitalism and humanize it by aligning it with the ethical ideals of social welfare while maintaining the capitalist mode of production, rather than creating an alternative socialist economic system. While usually promoting a plutocratic form of government and a heavily regulated market economy, some more radical streams exist."
social_liberal_subtype_desc: "Social Liberalism is a variation on mainstream classic liberalism, with the main difference being is the inclusion of various civil freedoms as basic human rights. Professing progressive social and economic policies the social liberals aim to create a society where every individual is free to live his own life with full opportunities regardless of their status."
classical_liberal_subtype_desc: "As a branch of mainline Liberalism that advocates for a free market and laissez-faire economics, and for civil liberties tied to economic and political freedom under the rule of law of a limited government. Differing from mainline Social Liberalism, Classical Liberals look more negatively on social policies, welfare systems, heavy taxation, and state involvement in the lives of its citizens, instead advocating for deregulation and decentralization, sharing some ideas with Liberal Conservatives, despite despising Conservative economics such as protectionism. Tied to the ‘original’ Liberals of the 19th Century, such as John Locke, Jean-Baptiste Say, Thomas Robert Malthus, and David Ricardo, Classical Liberalism is rooted in the ideas of Adam Smith, standing true to natural law, liberal progress, utilitarianism, and to the lessons learned during the rise of the Industrial Revolution and urbanization. From Hayek to Mises, Classical Liberals tow the line between the Center-Right and the Center-Left, seeking to bring about the ideas of the Enlightenment to their wayward shores."
social_conservative_subtype_desc: "Conservatism is a political ideology which can vary greatly depending on the political history of the region or nation. Nonetheless, it is normally centred on preserving traditional beliefs, attitudes and philosophy as well as the traditional power dynamic of society while using the democratic system. Opposed to both radical and moderate changes to the status quo, conservatives want to keep society in order and stable. Most conservative societies usually promote a regulated market economy and economic protectionism."
authoritarian_subtype_desc: "Authoritarianism is an ideology that combines a strong executive power with a representative parliament and a partial democratic political system. Authoritarian regimes often take a conservative stance on social issues, favour centralization and typically have Hawkish sentiments in-government; although isolationist branches of this ideology are not unheard of. The aim of these regimes is to maintain national stability and provide the people both a popular and responsible government."
revolutionary_nationalist_subtype_desc: "Revolutionary Nationalism is a political ideology that combines nationalist aspirations with revolutionary goals aimed at transforming society. Unlike reactionary ultranationalism, which seeks to preserve or return to a perceived golden age of the nation, revolutionary nationalism often seeks to redefine the nation in a more inclusive or progressive manner. It typically emphasizes the rights, interests, and sovereignty of a particular nation or ethnic group, often in the context of colonial or imperial domination. Revolutionary nationalists advocate for the liberation of their nation from external oppression, whether it be colonial rule, imperialism, or foreign intervention, and may employ various means, including armed struggle, mass mobilization, and political activism, to achieve their goals. Additionally, revolutionary nationalism may incorporate socialist or leftist principles, aiming for social justice, economic equality, and the empowerment of marginalized groups within the nation."
volkist_subtype_desc: "Volkism, officially recognized on papers as Popular Socialist Nationalism (Volkssozialistische Nationalismus), is a more authoritarian variant and form of revolutionary nationalism, created by the All-German Volkist People's Unity Party during the mid-1920s. The disdain for Western democracy, parliamentarism, capitalism, and socialism, led the Völkische theorists to create the third-way ideology, harbored with an idea of pan-Germanic cultural hegemony, pan-Germanism, Prussianistic Socialism, and corporatism. It aims to overcome the common social structure and create a homogenous community of people, Volksgemeinschaft, based on cultural hegemony. According to Rosenberg's school of German expansionism, the Volkists sought to unite all historical German territories and additional territory. The term Popular Socialist Nationalism attempts arose out of attempted creations of the nationalistic narrative of Socialism, as an alternative to Marxist Socialism and Market Capitalism, merging with the word "Popular", which opposed the socialist definition limited to worker, peasantry, and revolutionary, means to all social strata regardless of origins and nationality."
paternal_autocrat_subtype_desc: "Paternal Autocracy is not a political ideology in the normal sense of the word, but rather a general term for the attitude that these governments hold towards their citizens: The people are all subjects of the leader, either a king or a dictator, and it is the leader's job and duty to lead the state and society towards the righteous and best path while uniting the people of under his benevolent protection. These countries usually have a very authoritarian government, conservative social views and a state-controlled economy."
reactionary_ultranationalist_subtype_desc: "Reactionary ultranationalism is a political ideology marked by extreme nationalism and a nostalgic longing for a perceived idealized past, often coupled with a vehement rejection of modern social, cultural, or political changes. Advocates of this ideology typically seek to preserve or restore traditional values, hierarchies, and social structures, viewing them as essential to the identity and strength of their nation or ethnic group. Ultranationalists promote a sense of superiority and exclusivity, often advocating for aggressive or expansionist foreign policies and exhibiting xenophobic or racist attitudes towards outsiders and minority groups. These movements often gravitate towards authoritarianism, championing strong leadership or a ruling elite, and may employ tactics of repression and intolerance towards dissenting voices. Examples of reactionary ultranationalist movements in Europe, contemporary far-right movements, and certain forms of ethnonationalism."
